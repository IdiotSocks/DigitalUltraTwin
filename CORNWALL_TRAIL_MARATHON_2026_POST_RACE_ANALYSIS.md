## 🔬 PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA (VALIDATED WITH CORE SENSOR)

### Heart Rate Performance

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Avg HR** | 152 bpm | Moderately hard effort |
| **Max HR** | 181 bpm | Max threshold = 163 (exceeded during surges) |
| **Z2-Z3** | 66% | Majority in aerobic zones |
| **Z4** | 24% | Significant hard effort |

**Analysis:** Much harder effort than road marathon pace would suggest. 24% time in Z4 indicates terrain demanded constant power adjustments and harder work than flat road running.

### Power Data (FIRST VALIDATED TRAIL POWER METRICS!)

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Avg Power** | 289W | Sustained power output |
| **Normalized Power** | 337W | +17% vs avg |
| **Variability Index** | 1.17 | High terrain variability |
| **Total Work** | 5,005 kJ | Big aerobic day |
| **Power/km** | 6.85 W/km | Efficiency metric |

**Key Finding:** 17% NP/AP gap reflects terrain variability and constant power adjustments. Much higher than typical road VI of 1.03-1.05. This is **normal for technical trail running**.

### Core Temperature Management ✅

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Start Core Temp** | 37.16°C |
| **Peak Core Temp** | 38.54°C |
| **Rise** | +1.38°C |
| **Skin Temp Start** | 32.8°C |
| **Skin Temp End** | 27.2°C |
| **Data Points** | 18,726 |
| **Sensor Reliability** | Excellent (zero dropouts) |

**Validation:** Core sensor worked flawlessly for 5+ hours. Thermoregulation was **excellent** - peak temp 38.54°C is well below the 38.6°C critical threshold. Ambient cooling (22→17°C) in final hours helped prevent heat accumulation.

**Model Update:** This validates sustainable core temp rise of ~1.4°C for marathon distance efforts in moderate temperatures.

### Energy Depletion

| System | Start | Finish | Depletion | Rate |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Stamina** | 99 | 26 | 73 points | 1.73/km or 14.04/hr |
| **Body Battery** | 32 | 8 | 24 points | 4.6/hr |

**Analysis:** "Running on empty by finish" - significant energy depletion despite marathon distance. Contributing factors:
- Suboptimal nutrition timing
- Constant terrain variability (VI 1.17)
- Wind resistance (unaccounted for)

**Chianti 74K Projection:**
- 74 km × 1.73 depletion/km = **128 stamina points needed**
- Exceeds 100 → **WILL BONK without proper nutrition strategy**
- **Mitigation Required:** Early and consistent carb intake, 60-80g/hr target

### Running Dynamics

| Metric | Value | Comparison to Road |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| **Ground Contact Time** | 284ms | +~20ms longer |
| **Step Length** | 101cm | -~10cm shorter |

**Analysis:** Appropriate biomechanical adaptation for technical terrain. Longer GCT and shorter steps improve stability and reduce injury risk on variable surfaces.

## 📉 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: CORNWALL VS ARC 2025

### Direct Comparison (Similar Distance, Similar Terrain)

| Race | Date | Distance | Time | Pace | Speed | Fitness |
|------|------|----------|------|------|-------|---------|
| **Arc 2025** | Feb 9, 2025 | 42.1 km | 4:23:00 | 6:15/km | **9.6 km/h** | **1.15** |
| **Cornwall 2026** | Jan 25, 2026 | 42.18 km | 5:12:05 | 7:23/km | **8.1 km/h** | **1.05** |
| **Difference** | | +0.08 km | **+49 min** | +1:08/km | **-15.6%** | **-0.10** |

### Why Was Cornwall Slower?

**Fitness Gap:** 1.15 → 1.05 = -8.7% fitness
**Training Focus:** Arc = peaked for trail | Cornwall = road training (Seville prep)
**Race Execution:**
- ❌ Nutrition timing off
- ❌ Didn't account for wind
- ❌ Terrain more challenging than expected
- ✅ Core sensor test successful

**Model Prediction at Fitness 1.05:** 5:00-5:15
**Actual:** 5:12:05
**Accuracy:** ✅ **Within predicted range** (considering execution issues)

## 🏔️ CHIANTI 74K TRAJECTORY ASSESSMENT

### Current Status (Jan 26, 2026)

**Current Fitness:** 1.05
**Target Fitness:** 1.20
**Gap:** 0.15 fitness levels
**Time Available:** 7 weeks (until March 15, 2026)
**Weekly Gain Needed:** 0.021/week

### Is This Achievable?

**Assessment:** ✅ **ACHIEVABLE** with focused training post-Seville

**Required Timeline:**

| Phase | Dates | Focus | Expected Fitness |
|-------|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Seville Marathon** | ~Feb 16, 2026 | Peak road fitness | 1.10 |
| **Recovery** | Feb 17-23 | Active recovery | 1.08 |

   - Validates aerobic capacity
   - Builds confidence

2. **Quick Recovery** (5-7 days)
   - Active recovery only
   - Protect gains from Seville

3. **Trail-Specific Block** (2-3 weeks)
   - Focus: Long runs with elevation
   - Target: 2-3 runs of 25-35km with 800-1200m gain
   - Practice nutrition timing (fix Cornwall issues)
   - Build to fitness 1.18

4. **Taper** (final week)
   - Reduce volume, maintain intensity
   - Fresh legs for Chianti
   - Target fitness 1.18-1.20

## 🔍 KEY INSIGHTS FOR CHIANTI

### From Cornwall Data

**Nutrition is CRITICAL:**
- Cornwall: Poor nutrition timing → stamina depletion 73/42km = 1.73/km
- Chianti: 74km × 1.73 = **128 points** (will exceed 100 = BONK)
- **Solution:** Early intake (start at 30min), consistent 60-80g carbs/hr

**Power Variability on Trail:**
- VI 1.17 means constant adjustments
- Chianti will be similar (runnable but undulating)
- Train power consistency on varied terrain

**Thermoregulation is Strong:**
- Core temp rise 1.38°C well-managed
- Chianti March temps (12-16°C) even better
- No heat concerns expected

**Running Dynamics Adapt Well:**
- 284ms GCT, 101cm step = appropriate trail form
- Body naturally adjusts to terrain
- No efficiency concerns
